# Cookiecutter Django App Template

This repository provides a Cookiecutter template for generating a Django production-level app structure. It allows you to quickly set up a new app with predefined configurations, including naming conventions and configurations for `app_name` and `app_slug`.

We suggest you **do not** provide the app slug. It will automatically generate itself.  
If you choose to provide it, **there should be no spaces** between the app slug.

## Features

- **Predefined app structure**: Generates a Django app with common configurations.
- **Customizable settings**: Modify the app name during setup.
- **Easy to use**: Simply provide inputs for your new app, and the template does the rest.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to generate a new Django app using this template.

### 1. Install Cookiecutter
